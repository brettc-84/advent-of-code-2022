Advent of [co|go]de 2022

I'm doing [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) and this time in [GO](https://go.dev/)...

Disclaimer: I'm kind of (re)learning GoLang so it will be rough for at least the first bunch of days... hopefully the code gets cleaner and I learn a few tricks on the way :)
